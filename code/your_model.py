        # TODO: Build your own convolutional neural network, using Dropout at
        #       least once. The input image will be passed through each Keras
        #       layer in self.architecture sequentially. Refer to the imports
        #       to see what Keras layers you can use to build your network.
        #       Feel free to import other layers, but the layers already
        #       imported are enough for this assignment.
        #
        #       Remember: Your network must have under 15 million parameters!
        #       You will see a model summary when you run the program that
        #       displays the total number of parameters of your network.
        #
        #       Remember: Because this is a 15-scene classification task,
        #       the output dimension of the network must be 15. That is,
        #       passing a tensor of shape [batch_size, img_size, img_size, 1]
        #       into the network will produce an output of shape
        #       [batch_size, 15].
        #
        #       Note: Keras layers such as Conv2D and Dense give you the
        #             option of defining an activation function for the layer.
        #             For example, if you wanted ReLU activation on a Conv2D
        #             layer, you'd simply pass the string 'relu' to the
        #             activation parameter when instantiating the layer.
        #             While the choice of what activation functions you use
        #             is up to you, the final layer must use the softmax
        #             activation function so that the output of your network
        #             is a probability distribution.
        #
        #       Note: Flatten is a very useful layer. You shouldn't have to
        #             explicitly reshape any tensors anywhere in your network.
